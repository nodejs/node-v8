 *    tag and the marking bit in the unused upper bits) and the buffer size, or
 *  - A freelist entry, tagged with the kExternalPointerFreeEntryTag and

 *    first pointer-size word, or
 *  - An evacuation entry, tagged with the kExternalPointerEvacuationEntryTag
 *    and containing the address of the ExternalBufferSlot referencing the
 *    entry that will be evacuated into this entry. See the compaction
 *    algorithm overview for more details about these entries.

/**
 * A table storing pointer and size to buffer data located outside the sandbox.
 *
 * When the sandbox is enabled, the external buffer table (EBT) is used to
 * safely reference buffer data located outside of the sandbox. The EBT
 * guarantees that every access to the buffer data via an external pointer
 * either results in an invalid pointer or a valid pointer to a valid (live)
 * buffer of the expected type. The EBT also stores the size of the buffer data
 * as part of each entry to allow for bounds checking.
 *
 * Table memory management:
 * ------------------------
 * The garbage collection algorithm works as follows:
 *  - One bit of every entry is reserved for the marking bit.
 *  - Every store to an entry automatically sets the marking bit when ORing
 *    with the tag. This avoids the need for write barriers.
 *  - Every load of an entry automatically removes the marking bit when ANDing
 *    with the inverted tag.
 *  - When the GC marking visitor finds a live object with an external pointer,
 *    it marks the corresponding entry as alive through Mark(), which sets the
 *    marking bit using an atomic CAS operation.
 *  - When marking is finished, SweepAndCompact() iterates over a Space once
 *    while the mutator is stopped and builds a freelist from all dead entries
 *    while also removing the marking bit from any live entry.
 *
 * Table compaction:
 * -----------------
 * Additionally, the external buffer table supports compaction.
 * For details about the compaction algorithm see the
 * CompactibleExternalEntityTable class.
